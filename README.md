## Features Left to Implement
As a future enhancement, i would like to introduce the ability for sudents to login and book classes, but time restrains and knowledge gaps meant this was not possible. This would ensure users would not be disappointed by turning up to a full class, and would provide the site owner information on how many users are booked into each class to avoid overcrowded classes and offer incentives for users to join classes with low numbers. It would also provide the site owner information on who has booked a class in case they need to contact end users due to class cancelations.
